**Notes:**

To get reasonable efficiency, i.e., O(log(n)), a binary search was preferable for searching the sorted array.
The STL function lower_bound() served for this. (See http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/table_of_contents.html)

**Note about source comments:**

This solution is intentionally written in an expressive and self-documenting style, so as to not need
any source comments.
