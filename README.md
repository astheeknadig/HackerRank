# HackerRank
**My solutions to challenges on hackerrank.com**.

Most are in **PHP**, or **C++** for speed or other reasons. Some **Java** might be included at times.

If it's a Functional Programming challenge, it will be either **Scala** or **Haskell**. 

*Pull Requests*:  Pull requests accepted for a valid solution in a different language or a using a different algorithm.

If you find any problem with the solutions - for any reason, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/dtison/HackerRank/issues).
